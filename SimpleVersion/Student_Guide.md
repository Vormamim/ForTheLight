## Game Overview

### The Story
Your spaceship has crashed on an alien planet! The energy generator has broken into 6 pieces scattered across 10 different locations. You must find all the pieces before your energy runs out, or you'll be stranded forever!

### Game Mechanics
- **Energy System**: Start with 50 energy, lose 3 per move, gain 10 per item found
- **Time Pressure**: Energy decays 1 point every 3 turns
- **Exploration**: 10 locations arranged in a grid pattern
- **Victory**: Collect all 6 generator pieces
- **Defeat**: Run out of energy

### Visual Map

## Project Structure

Our game consists of three main files:

```
SimpleVersion/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py          # Main game loop and user interface
â”œâ”€â”€ functions.py     # Game functions and logic
â”œâ”€â”€ data.py         # Game data (locations, items, descriptions)
â””â”€â”€ show_map.py     # Visual map display
```

### Why Split Code Into Files?
- **Organization**: Easier to find and modify specific parts
- **Reusability**: Functions can be used in multiple places
- **Collaboration**: Different people can work on different files
- **Maintenance**: Easier to fix bugs and add features

---

## Programming Concepts

### 1. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

**Why use functions?**
- Avoid repeating code
- Make code easier to read
- Break complex problems into smaller pieces
- Allow for easier testing and debugging

**Example:**
```python
def show_location(location_number, inventory):
    """Display the current location description"""
    print(f"--- {LOCATION_NAMES[location_number]} ---")
    print(LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS[location_number])
```

### 2. Lists
Lists store multiple items in a single variable.

**Why use lists?**
- Store related data together
- Access items by position (index)
- Easily add or remove items
- Loop through all items

**Example:**
```python
LOCATION_NAMES = [
    "Crash Site",      # Index 0
    "Rocky Outcrop",   # Index 1
    "Crystal Cave"     # Index 2
]
```

### 3. Variables
Variables store data that can change during the program.

**Game State Variables:**
```python
player_location = 0    # Current location index
player_energy = 50     # Current energy level
inventory = []         # List of found items
turn_count = 0         # Number of turns taken
```

### 4. Loops
Loops repeat code until a condition is met.

**Main Game Loop:**
```python
while True:  # Run forever until break
    # Show current state
    # Get user input
    # Process command
    # Check win/lose conditions
```

### 5. Conditionals
Conditionals make decisions based on conditions.

**Command Processing:**
```python
if command == "quit":
    break
elif command == "look":
    continue
elif command.startswith("go "):
    # Handle movement
```

## Code Walkthrough

### File 1: data.py - Game Data

This file contains all the game's static data using simple lists.

#### Location Names
```python
LOCATION_NAMES = [
    "Crash Site",           # 0
    "Rocky Outcrop",        # 1
    "Crystal Cave",         # 2
    "Dense Forest",         # 3
    "Ancient Ruins",        # 4
    "Frozen Lake",          # 5
    "Volcanic Vents",       # 6
    "Metal Wreckage",       # 7
    "Strange Monolith",     # 8
    "Energy Crater"         # 9
]
```

**Key Concept**: Using list indexes (0-9) to reference locations makes movement calculations easier.

#### Location Descriptions
```python
LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS = [
    "The twisted remains of your ship lie scattered here. Smoke still rises from the wreckage.",
    "Jagged rocks jut from the ground like broken teeth. The wind howls between them.",
    # ... more descriptions
]
```

**Key Concept**: Parallel lists - the description at index 1 describes the location at index 1.

#### Items at Locations
```python
LOCATION_ITEMS = [
    None,                    # 0 - Crash Site (no item)
    "Power Core Fragment",   # 1 - Rocky Outcrop
    "Energy Crystal",        # 2 - Crystal Cave
    # ... more items
]
```

**Key Concept**: Using `None` to represent "no item" - this is a common Python pattern.

### File 2: functions.py - Game Logic

This file contains all the game's functions.

#### Displaying Locations
```python
def show_location(location_number, inventory):
    """Display the current location description and available items"""
    print(f"\n--- {LOCATION_NAMES[location_number]} ---")
    print(LOCATION_DESCRIPTIONS[location_number])
    
    # Show exits based on grid position
    exits = []
    if location_number not in [0, 1, 2]:  # Not in top row
        exits.append("south")
    if location_number not in [7, 8, 9]:  # Not in bottom row
        exits.append("north")
    # ... more exit logic
    
    if exits:
        print(f"You can go: {', '.join(exits)}")
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Function parameters**: `location_number` and `inventory` are inputs
- **List operations**: Using `not in` to check if location is in a list
- **String formatting**: Using f-strings to insert variables into text
- **List methods**: Using `join()` to combine list items into a string

#### Movement Logic
```python
def move_player(current_location, direction):
    """Move the player in the given direction, return new location"""
    if direction == "north":
        if current_location >= 3:  # Can move north if not in top row
            return current_location - 3
        else:
            return current_location  # Can't move, stay in place
    
    elif direction == "south":
        if current_location <= 6:  # Can move south if not in bottom row
            return current_location + 3
        else:
            return current_location
    # ... more directions
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Grid mathematics**: Moving north subtracts 3, south adds 3, east adds 1, west subtracts 1
- **Boundary checking**: Preventing invalid moves
- **Return values**: Functions can send data back to the caller

#### Game State Management
```python
def check_game_over(energy, inventory):
    """Check if the game is over (win or lose)"""
    if len(inventory) >= 6:
        print("ðŸŽ‰ CONGRATULATIONS! ðŸŽ‰")
        print("You found all 6 generator pieces!")
        return True
    
    if energy <= 0:
        print("ðŸ’€ GAME OVER ðŸ’€")
        print("You ran out of energy!")
        return True
    
    return False
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Boolean return values**: Functions can return `True` or `False`
- **Multiple conditions**: Checking both win and lose conditions
- **List length**: Using `len()` to count items

### File 3: main.py - Game Loop

This file contains the main game logic and user interface.

#### Game Initialization
```python
def main():
    """Main game loop"""
    # Game introduction
    print("=" * 50)
    print("           DEAD SHIP")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    # Initialize game state
    player_location = 0  # Start at crash site
    player_energy = 50   # Starting energy
    inventory = []       # Empty inventory
    turn_count = 0       # Track turns
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Initialization**: Setting up starting values
- **Comments**: Explaining what variables represent
- **String multiplication**: Using `"=" * 50` to create decorative lines

#### Main Game Loop
```python
while True:
    # Show current location
    show_location(player_location, inventory)
    
    # Show player status
    print(f"\nEnergy: {player_energy}")
    print(f"Generator pieces found: {len(inventory)}/6")
    
    # Check if game is over
    if check_game_over(player_energy, inventory):
        break
    
    # Get player input
    command = input("\nWhat do you do? ").strip().lower()
    
    # Process commands...
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Infinite loop**: `while True` runs until `break`
- **User input**: `input()` gets text from the player
- **String methods**: `strip()` removes spaces, `lower()` converts to lowercase
- **Function calls**: Using functions we defined in other files

#### Command Processing
```python
if command == "quit":
    print("Thanks for playing!")
    break

elif command == "look":
    continue  # Just redisplay location

elif command == "inventory":
    show_inventory(inventory)
    continue

elif command.startswith("go "):
    direction = command[3:]  # Get direction after "go "
    new_location = move_player(player_location, direction)
    
    if new_location != player_location:
        player_location = new_location
        player_energy -= 3  # Moving costs energy
        
        # Check for items
        found_item = check_for_item(player_location)
        if found_item and found_item not in inventory:
            print(f"\nYou found a {found_item}!")
            add_to_inventory(inventory, found_item)
            player_energy += 10  # Finding item restores energy
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **String slicing**: `command[3:]` gets everything after position 3
- **String methods**: `startswith()` checks if string begins with text
- **State changes**: Updating variables based on player actions
- **Conditional logic**: Different outcomes based on player input

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now learned how to create a complete text adventure game using Python. This project demonstrates many fundamental programming concepts:

- **Problem solving** - Breaking down a complex game into smaller parts
- **Code organization** - Using multiple files and functions
- **Data management** - Using lists to store game information
- **User interaction** - Processing commands and providing feedback
- **Game logic** - Implementing rules and win/lose conditions

### Next Steps

1. **Experiment** - Try the exercises and extensions
2. **Customize** - Change the story, locations, or mechanics
3. **Share** - Show your game to friends and family
4. **Learn more** - Explore advanced Python concepts like classes and file I/O

Remember: Programming is about solving problems creatively. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes - that's how you learn!
